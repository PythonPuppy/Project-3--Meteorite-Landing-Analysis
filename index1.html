          <h4>What are Meteorites?</h4>
          <p>A meteorite is a meteoroid (a piece of an asteroid or comet) that 
          survives the passage through the Earth's atmosphere and lands on the earth.
          <br><br>
          </p>
          <h4>How often do Meteorites strike?</h4>
          <p>Almost everyday our planet is bombarded with tons of small particles and dust
          some of which our atmosphere protects our planet from.
          <br><br>
          About once a year, an automobile-sized asteroid hits Earth's atmosphere, 
          creates an impressive fireball, and burns up before reaching the surface.
          <br><br>
          Every 2,000 years or so, a meteoroid the size of a football field hits 
          Earth and causes significant damage to the area.
          <br><br>
          Only once every few million years, an object large enough to threaten 
          Earth's civilization comes along. Impact craters on Earth, the moon and 
          other planetary bodies are evidence of these occurrences.
          <br><br>
          It is believed that anything larger than half mile in diameter could 
          have worldwide effects.
          <br><br>
          Weighing in at 66 tons, the largest known meteorite found is 
          <a href="http://geology.com/records/largest-meteorite/">Hoba</a> in 
          Namibia, Africa.

        <h4>Population Density View</h4>
        <p>While the first view illustrates the meteorite strikes on the world map, 
        this view gives an emphasis on the population density of those 
        regions to visualize the effect of meteorite strikes on human life.<br><br>
        This view lightens the areas of the world with intensity proportional to
        the population. Antarctica is an exception as based on the scale of 
        population density, it should not even show up. Although it currently has a 
        floating research population it has imputed in the map for the sake of sanity.<br><br> 
        The data for population density has been procured from the 
        <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.DNST">World Bank</a> website and 
        and the numbers are from the year 2016. 
        While the numbers might not be indicative of the actual population 
        density at the time of meteorite strike, this view attempts to analyze a
        new aspect of the visualization - whether we can draw a parallel between
        the population density and the number of meteorites found.
        Moreover, this view could also provide caution to countries where a meteorite
        strike is expected.

        <h4>About the Data</h4>
        <p>The primary data used in this visualization comes from 
        NASA's Data Portal, and is based on The Meteoritical Society's 
        Meteoritical Bulletin Database (this latter database provides additional 
        information such as meteorite images, links to primary sources, etc.).
